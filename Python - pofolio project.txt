I'm going for a Rock ,  Paper, and Scissor game with  Health points. The game will also add a forth option called "Predict" which will have it's own win / loose rule.

The concept of the game is to get as many wins as possible before your health drops to 0. 

Have the computer secretly select a random option between rock, scissors, paper, and predict.
Prompt the user to choose between rock, scissors, paper and predict.
Take string input from user and compare it against the computer's choice.
Determine who has won: 
If user and computer chose the same option besides predict, it is a tie. No health is taken from the player.
If one chose rock, and one chose scissors, rock has won. If the user player lost, the user's health points is reduced from the value given to rock. 
If one chose scissors, and one chose paper, scissors has won. If the user player lost, the user's health points is reduced from the value given to scissors.  
If one chose paper, and one chose rock, paper has won. If the user player lost, the user's health points is reduced from the value given to paper.
If the user and computer choose predict, this counts as a win for the player and increase the players HP by a set amount.
if the user choose predict and the computer does not, the player looses that interaction and takes double reduction of the computer choice.
Every time a user wins an interaction, increase the win count by 1
If the user HP drops to 0, display game over and the total number of wins
Ask the player if they want to try again. 
Quit if they say no, and start from the beginning if they say yes.
